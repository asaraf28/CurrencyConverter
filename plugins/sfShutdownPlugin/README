# sfShutdownPlugin

This plugin allows you to executes functions after the page
has been sent to the browser, like register_shutdown_function() does.
However, as the shutdown functions are called in the order they were
registered, your functions will always run after the Symfony shutdown methods
are called, rendering many parts of Symfony unusable.
This plugin allows you to register your functions so that they will be called
before Symfony shuts down.

## Installation

Just install the plugin, no configuration needed.
If the plugin is improperly loaded, it will throw an exception the first time you
try to call a sfShutdown method.

## Examples

    sfShutdown::add('myfunction');

    sfShutdown::add(array('Foo', 'shutdown'), array('myparam1', 'myparam2'));
